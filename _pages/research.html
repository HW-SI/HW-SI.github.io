Research Experience
======

* **Constraining Hadronic Processes in Past Sgr A* Jets**  
  *Supervisor: Sera Markoff | Tools: Python, BHJet/HADJet, ISIS, Gammapy*  
  *Amsterdam, Netherlands | Sep. 2025 – Present*  
  - End-to-end lepto–hadronic modeling of Sgr A*’s past jet, linking CR production to detector predictions.  
  - Reproducing multi-wavelength baselines in ISIS and refining HADJet proton injection setups.  
  - Modeling cosmic-ray confinement and diffusion in the Galactic Center.  
  - Folding outputs through CTA/KM3NeT instrument responses to forecast detectable γ-ray and neutrino signatures.

* **XENONnT Experiment: Dark Matter & Detector Calibration**  
  *Supervisor: Jingqiang Ye | Tools: Python, Data Pipelines, Correction Algorithms*  
  *Shenzhen, China | Feb. 2024 – Sep. 2024*  
  - Contributed to XENONnT dark matter search, focusing on detector calibration and low-energy event analysis.  
  - Calibrated with Krypton-83m injections to monitor xenon purity, drift fields, and PMT stability.  
  - Developed correction algorithm for false photoionization events, improving low-energy sensitivity.  
  - Identified detector artifact mimicking neutrino magnetic moment signals, reducing systematic errors.

* **MHD Simulation: Tracing Alfvén Waves in Solar Wind**  
  *Supervisor: Xin Cheng | Tools: Python, MPI-AMRVAC, Fortran, Bash*  
  *Nanjing, China | July 2023 – Sep. 2023*  
  - Modeled Alfvén wave propagation in the slow solar wind using MPI-AMRVAC (1D diffusion setup).  
  - Configured computational grids, solvers, and boundary conditions to study wave transport and damping.  
  - Explored challenges such as dispersion, damping, and numerical stability in plasma modeling.  
  - Built foundation for future higher-dimensional plasma simulations.

* **LAMOST Survey: Stellar Activity & Spectral Variations**  
  *Supervisor: Pengfei Chen | Tools: Python, FITS, K-means clustering, correlation analysis*  
  *Nanjing, China | June 2021 – Aug. 2021*  
  - Analyzed LAMOST spectra to study stellar activity (H-alpha, Fe lines) and solar-like stars (G6–G9).  
  - Processed spectra and applied machine learning (K-means) to detect anomalies and variability.  
  - Found activity correlates with lower surface gravity and higher radial velocity, not metallicity.  
  - Gained hands-on skills in spectral data reduction and stellar activity diagnostics.
