Hi, I’m **Haowen Si**, a Master’s student in Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Sera Markoff](https://seramarkoff.com). I work on black-hole jet modeling and their role in high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos within a **multi-messenger** framework.

My current focus is on **microquasars**—stellar-mass black holes with relativistic jets—using nearby sources such as **V4641 Sgr** as time-resolvable laboratories for jet physics. The core questions are the same ones I care about across systems: **how particles are accelerated in jets** and **how jets couple to their surrounding medium**, shaping the gamma-ray and neutrino emission we can detect.

The past jet of Sgr A* also appears here as a **reference SMBH source** to give context across mass scales.

### Current project
I’m building an end-to-end pipeline that connects:
- **Jet emission models (BHJet/HADJet)** to predict lepto–hadronic particle populations and radiation;
- **Jet termination / interaction regions**, capturing shocks and energy transfer into the ambient medium;
- **Particle transport in the Galactic environment**, tracking propagation and cooling once particles leave the jet;
- **Detector-space predictions**, folding outputs through **CTA** and **KM3NeT** responses to forecast detectable signatures.

This program aims to compare **microquasars and SMBHs** to clarify jet acceleration and jet–environment coupling under different scales and conditions.
