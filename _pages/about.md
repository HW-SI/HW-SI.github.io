Hi, I’m **Haowen Si**, a master’s student in high-energy astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Sera Markoff](https://seramarkoff.com). My research focuses on black holes and their role in accelerating cosmic rays.  

Modern telescopes have revealed that nearly every galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole at its center — including our own. The Milky Way’s black hole, **Sgr A\***, is believed to have launched powerful jets millions of years ago, possibly producing the very high-energy particles we still detect today.  

My current project aims to build a complete framework tracing this process: from the birth of these particles near the black hole, through their escape into the tangled magnetic fields of the Galactic Center, to their eventual detection on Earth. This work seeks to deepen our understanding of how jets accelerate particles and to shed light on the “ghost” particles arriving at our detectors today.

Beyond extreme astrophysics, I have explored diverse topics — from coding theory to machine learning, from solar physics to dark matter — and I am always happy to discuss ideas across these areas.
